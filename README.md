# TFMatlab
This repository contains the simulation scripts for a local parameter identifiability study based on sensitivity anlysis on four different dynamic disease systems:
-  **SIS model**: The susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model.
-  **SIR model**: The susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental model.
-  **Influenza virus model**: Compartmental model + population dynamics system. A group of cells (divided in uninfected and infected subpopulations) interacts with a virus titer.
-  **HIV model**: Compartmental model for the human immunodeficency virus. The population is divided in four different groups: uninfected cells, cells infected by mutant virus, cells infected by wild-type virus and dual infected cells.

We also included a pdf with the results on the command window for the considered parameters.

## Developement
Scripts has been created on MATLAB R2022a.
